#Scatter Plot : The idea behind this scatter plot is a bivariate analysis that is to understand
#               how does one variable change with respect to another variable and over here.I'm
#               trying to understand how does sepal length change with respect to petal length
#               in the left i have given sepal length it will be plotted on Y-Aixs
#               and on the right i have given petal length it will be plotted on X-Axis
